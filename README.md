# get_next_line
42 Scholl project Repository

The 42 school's get_next_line project aims to code a function get_next_line that returns a single line from a given file descriptor. 
If called in a loop, get_next_line returns the entire contents of a file, line by line until it reaches the end of the file. 
It has to work with any buffer size, and the buffer size can be specified at compilation.

Learn to read from a file descriptor, as well as the use of static variables.
